# My Cafe

This project involves data analysis of customer orders and cafe items. Customers make request to employees such as purchasing and refunding items.

## Purpose

Employees keep track with inventory to see what items are available to let customers know. Generating revenue is also essential to restock goods, pay employees and rent, etc. 

## Data Analysis

**DataFrames** and **graphs** are utilized to track orders and items from the cafe. 

Order numbers are distinctive values to keep track of customers and they may want to propose a request. For instance, when customers wanted a refund from all or certain items, we can refer to their order numbers.
